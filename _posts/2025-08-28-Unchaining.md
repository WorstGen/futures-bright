Crypto has exploded. What started with a few new coins and blockchains each year has turned into thousands of new chains and tokens launching daily.

At first, this seems great—more options, more innovation. But there's a big problem: liquidity is getting scattered everywhere.

🚨 The Problem: Crypto is Too Fragmented

Imagine if every store had its own version of money. You couldn’t use one currency everywhere, and you’d constantly be swapping between different ones just to buy things. That’s what’s happening in crypto today.

Liquidity (the money in the system) is spread across:

Bridges (slow and risky)

Layer 2s & 3s (they don’t unify liquidity, just shift it around)

Liquidity pools (LPs) on different chains (hard to move between them)

Instead of working together, these systems are competing, making it harder and more expensive for users to move money freely across crypto.

🔑 The Solution: Unchaining

Instead of forcing liquidity into one place (which never works), we need a way for liquidity to move freely across all chains—without relying on trusted middlemen or risky bridges.

H Wonder calls this Unchaining:

✅ No more liquidity being locked in silos
✅ No more depending on bridges to move money
✅ A system where value can move across different blockchains freely
This isn’t just an idea—it’s the next evolution of crypto.

🏦 Fixing Wallets – Making Crypto Easier to Use

Crypto wallets today are too complicated for most people.

❌ Too many steps just to make a transaction
❌ Confusing network settings
❌ Security risks (fake tokens, phishing attacks)
❌ No easy way to recover an account

The fix? A simpler, more secure login system—like Web2, but decentralized.
One login for all chains

Easy account recovery

Automatic gas and fee management

If crypto is ever going to truly go mainstream, the user experience needs to be as simple as logging into your email.

⚡ Fixing Transactions – No More MEV Bots Taking Your Money

Right now, Ethereum’s system allows bots to front-run your transactions and take a cut (this is called MEV). It makes transactions more expensive and unfair.

The fix? A new system where transactions are executed based on intent, not bots competing to take a slice of the action.
